/* SPEST ISSUE:
   Javac didn't generate a .class file for this .java file, and so the Spest
   checker isn't happy about that.  This may be OK, but it might be worth
   looking into a way to eliminating the Spest error message "No .class file
   found for: null, so the file was skipped" in cases like this.
