<p>
LearnBoost is a new grading program for teachers and students that brings a fresh new feel to the way grading programs look and act. LearnBoost is a web based grading application that provides teachers the functionality to input grades easily, add students to certain classes, and examine different graphs of student progression throughout the course. 
</p><p>
Overall, LearnBoost provides a range of grading tools to the user, but also sacrifices some of its functionality for ease of use and presentation to the user.
