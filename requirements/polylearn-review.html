PolyLearn is a web based classroom management software, used by California
Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. It is developed on top of
an open source platform called Moodle. PolyLearn provides functionality for
teachers to post links and information to students, open up forums for
dialogue, administer quizzes, collect assignments, and post grades.
