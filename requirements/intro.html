This document defines requirements for a Grade Manager and Browser. The grade manager and browser maintains grading information for a course, computes statistics, and manages electronic submission of graded work. Teachers will use this grade manager to update and maintain grading information of students throughout a course. Students will use this program to look up their grades on different assignments, turn in assignments electronically, and to predict their final grades. 
</p><p>
In addition to providing useful functionality, the Grade Manager and Browser serves as a pedagogical example of software engineering concepts and principles. The software development artifacts for the Grade Manager and Browser are considered part of the overall Grade Manager and Browser package.
