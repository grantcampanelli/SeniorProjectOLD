<h4>
Save

<p>
When the user selects <tt>Save</tt> from the <tt>File</tt> menu, the system saves any changes that has been made to the gradebook since the last save. Although the application saves any changes that are made as soon as they are made, this menu item is explicitely supported under 

<tt>File</tt> menu to provide the users of application with the confidence of data save. For each manual save (with the click of <tt>Save</tt> menu item), the application looks for any changes either by parsing the gradebook or utilizing the list of commands stored (primarily for <tt>Undo</tt> function under <tt>Edit</tt>), and sends the unsaved entries to the server to save them.
