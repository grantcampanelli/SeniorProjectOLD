<p>All Grader functionality should execute instantaneously, except for the following:

<ul>
    <li>
        Synchronizing students with the student server
    </li>
    <li>
        Logging in should take some extra time
    </li>
    <li>
        Exporting into various file formats
    </li>
    <li>
        Submitting Scores to school server
    </li>
    <li>
        Submitting and Retrieving files for electronic submissions
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The time to execute all administrative commands must be instantaneous, except
    for any delays due to network transmission of data from the central host.
<p>
    In general, the performance of Grader Tool commands that must access data
    across a network is subject to potential network delays.  The Grader Tool
    must transmit data as fast as is possible on any given network, but delays due
    to external network circumstances are beyond the control of the Grader Tool.
<p>
    There are no specific requirements for the allowable size of a grader in
    terms of the number of assignments and submitted grades.  A Grader on the order of thousands
    of items is the maximum expected size during normal use.
<p>
    The maximum expected sizes of the Grader Tool databases are the following:
<ul>
    <li>
        user database -- up to tens of thousands of records
    <li>
        group database -- up to thousands of records
    <li>
        location database -- up to tens of thousands of records
</ul>
While there may on the order of tens of thousands of registered users, the
expected maximum number of users connected to any given server at any given
time is on the order of hundreds.
<p>
    The Grader Tool must be able to operate with graders and databases of sizes
    larger than these normal maximums.  However, the tool need not the meet the
    previously-enumerated time performance requirements for graders and databases
    larger than normal maximum sizes.
