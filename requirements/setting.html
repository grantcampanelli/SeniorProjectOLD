1.3.  Operational Setting
</h3>
</a>
<p>
There are three operational settings for the Grader Tool: (1) the Cal Poly 
computer science department; (2) other departments at Cal Poly; (3) other people
who need grading software. The Grader Tool is intended to be general public
domain software.
</p>
<p>
There is a single primary customer for the Grader Tool, and he is representative
of instructors at Cal Poly. The setting for which the Grader Tool is
appropriately suited is a classroom or educational environment where students
are graded. In this setting, instructors maintain student grades for a course
and students want to view their grades on each assignment. As such, the tool's
requirements reflect these needs.
