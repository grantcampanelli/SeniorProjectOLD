<p>
       There should be a number of security features built in to the Grader too.
        There will be the need to only show some data to specific roles.
        And example of such is the EmplID of students should only be visible to teachers.
        Other functionality that has security protocols would be changing grades
        and adding students to the roster. There should be a role manager to give permissions.

<p>
        On a spectrum of simple-to-use versus powerful, the Grader Tool is in the middle between the two sides.
        Users are assumed to be mostly computer literate for some functionality, but
        there is also implementation to make it simple to understand for a less computer literate user.
