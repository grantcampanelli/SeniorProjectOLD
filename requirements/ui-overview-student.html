2.1.2  User Interface Overview - Student/TA View
</h3>
</a>
<p>
When the user initially invokes the Grader Manager and Browser, the screen appears as shown
in Figure 1. The initial display consists of one window: a standard form of pulldown
command menu and a display of the current grade book. There is also a quick menu which the user can use to more quickly perform certain key actions. To the right is a graphical representation of grade trends and near the bottom are each category and their associated weight, mean, median, and standard deviation. The Student and TA views differ from the Instructor view based on what permissions the instructor have given either a Student or TA. Student's and TA's by default can not see other students grades other than their own.

The <tt>File</tt> menu contains commands that output the current state of the
grade book to disk and other endpoints.
The '<tt>File Save</tt>' command writes the current state of the grade book to
disk-based storage.
'<tt>File Publish Student View</tt>' updates the grade book data that is visible
to students. 
'<tt>File Commit Final Grades</tt>' reports each student's final grade to the
Office of the Registrar for official record keeping.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>Edit</tt> menu contains commands for manipulating the grade book. 
'<tt>Edit Undo</tt>' reverts the most recent change that the user made since
starting the application. The user may invoke undo multiple times to revert more
that one change.
'<tt>Edit Redo</tt>' executes the change that undo last reverted. This command
is only available when no changes have been made since invoking undo. Repeated
invocations of '<tt>Redo</tt>' will restore undone commands in the order they
were given.
'<tt>Edit Cut</tt>' stores the current selection in the user's clipboard
and removes it from the grade book.
'<tt>Edit Copy</tt>' stores the current selection in the user's clipboard.
'<tt>Edit Paste</tt>' inserts the user's clipboard into the grade book at
currently selected edit point. This command is only available when the user's
clipboard contains compatible data.
'<tt>Edit Delete</tt>' removes the current selection from the grade book.
'<tt>Edit Find</tt>' searches all grade books loaded into the application for a
given text string. Successive invocations of search with an unchanged search
string cause the program to search for additional occurrences of the string
until all occurrences are found.
'<tt>Edit Clear</tt>' removes all data from a row or column in the grade book.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>Class</tt> menu provides commands for creating and managing classes.

'<tt>Class Grade Schema</tt>' allows the user to change the class's grade
schema. A grade schema defines how a numeric value for a grade maps to a letter
grade like A, B, C, D, and F.
'<tt>Class Late Policy...</tt>' allows the user to change the class's late
policy. A late policy defines the penalty applied to a grade for an assignment 
that is submitted late.
