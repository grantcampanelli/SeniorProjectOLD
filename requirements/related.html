<p>Commercial systems that provide functionality comparable to the
  Grader Tool include </p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.polylearnsupport.calpoly.edu">Cal Poly PolyLearn (Moodle),
</a>
<li>
<a href="http://www.blackboard.com/">Blackboard,
</a>
<li>

</a>
<li>
<a href="http://www.instructure.com/higher-education/">Instructure Canvas
</a>
</ul>
<p>
Each of these systems provides a wide variety of class mananagement and grading
functionality.  In terms of such functionality, the goal for the Grader Tool
is to provide the important core features found in these tools, not the full
range of features found in all of them.  The Grader Tool does provide modest
functional improvements in three areas, when compared to most commercially
available tools.  These improvements are:
<ol type=a>
<p> <li>
more flexibility for the instructor to set the class curve with a graphical interface
<p> <li>
more fliexiblity for the sub-class level group management such as project teams
<p> <li>
additional features that allows students to predict their final course grade based on currently graded assignments and future assignments, as well as with the graphical view of how well a student is doing relative to his or her classmates.
</ol>
<p>
The goals for the Grader Tool relating to public domain source code and sound
pedagogical development are not met by any of the above commercial systems.
