<a name="Undo">
<h4>
Undo and Redo
</h4>
</a>
</a>
<p>
When the user selects <tt>Undo</tt> from the <tt>Edit</tt> menu, the system
undoes the effect of the most recently confirmed updating command, or the
effect of a previously executed <tt>Undo</tt> command.  An <em>updating
command</em> is any Grader Tool command that changes information in the spreadsheet.

For any of these actions, the precise definition of <tt>Undo</tt> is that the
Grader Tool workspace is restored to the state that existed immediately prior
to the confirmed execution of the action.  If no confirmed updating command has
been executed since the Grader Tool was invoked, <tt>Undo</tt> has no effect.
<p>
If <tt>Undo</tt> is executed twice in succession, with no intervening confirmed
update between the two executions, the effect of the first of the two
<tt>Undo</tt> executions is undone.  That is, the state of the workspace is
restored to the state that existed immediately prior to the first
<tt>Undo</tt>.  Third and further successive executions of <tt>Undo</tt>,
without an intervening updating command, cause the system to toggle between the
state of the workspace with and without the effect of the most recently
confirmed update.  This behavior means that only a single level of undo is
available.  That is, only the single most recently executed updating command
can be undone.
<p>
<tt>Undo</tt> only applies to the updating commands and itself, not to any
other commands such as Publishing Grades. <tt>Redo</tt> has the same functionality
and restrictions as <tt>Undo</tt> only it restores the state of the Grader Tool
workspace to one that existed preceding the confirmed execution of an updating command.

<a name="text editing">
<a name="Cut, Copy, and Paste">
<h4>
Cut, Copy, and Paste
</h4>
</a>
</a>
<p>
<a name="clipboard">
Operating systems typically provide a "clipboard" area through which cut and
paste editing commands operate.
</a>
This clipboard holds values that are cut, copied, and pasted in tools such as
the Grader.  Hence, the <tt>Grader</tt> <tt>Cut</tt>, <tt>Copy</tt>, and
<tt>Paste</tt> commands operate through such a clipboard.
<p>
To execute the <tt>Cut</tt> or <tt>Copy</tt> command, the user must first
select a segment of text in a text box or row of student data.  Text selection is performed using
click and drag with the mouse, or by other environment-specific means such as
double or triple clicking in a text box.
<p>
After text selection, when the user selects the <tt>Cut</tt> command from the
<tt>Edit</tt> menu, the system removes the selected text from the edit box and
copies the text into the clipboard.  When the user selects the <tt>Copy</tt>
command, the selected text is copied to the clipboard, but is not removed from
the display in which it is selected and the text remains selected.  A
particular segment of selected text is <em>unselected</em> by selecting another
text segment or by single-clicking the mouse anywhere in the Grader display.
Other environment-specific means of unselecting text may be available.
<p>
<a name="text cutting restrictions">
The <tt>Cut</tt> command can only be executed in the context of a display where
the text boxes are editable, i.e., where the user may type in the text boxes.
</a>
In contrast to <tt>Cut</tt>, the <tt>Copy</tt> command can be executed in any
dialog in which text boxes appear, including read-only text boxes.
<p>
To execute the <tt>Paste</tt> command, the user must first execute a
<tt>Cut</tt> or <tt>Copy</tt> and then place the typing cursor within some
editable text box.  After these steps, when the user selects the <tt>Paste</tt>
command from the <tt>Edit</tt> menu, the text stored in the clipboard is
inserted at the point of the typing cursor, as if it had been entered by the
user from the keyboard.  Pasted text appears in normal font, i.e., it is not
highlighted as selected text.
<p>
If the user attempts to execute a <tt>Cut</tt> or <tt>Copy</tt> command without
first selecting text, the commands have no effect.  If the user attempts to
execute a <tt>Paste</tt> command without having executed either a <tt>Cut</tt>
or <tt>Copy</tt>, the <tt>Paste</tt> command has no effect.  The <tt>Cut</tt>,
<tt>Copy</tt>, and <tt>Paste</tt> commands operate only on plain text strings
within a single displayed text box.
<p>
The use of the clipboard for communication between the Grader Tool and the
outside operating environment depends on the capabilities of the environment.
Specifically, the environment must support the insertion and removal of plain
text to and from the clipboard.  If this requirement is met, and the operating
environment permits inter-tool clipboard communication, then plain text copied
to the clipboard from a another tool can be pasted in the Grader using
<tt>Paste</tt>.  Similarly, plain text cut or copied in the Grader Tool can
be pasted or otherwise accessed as plain text in another tool, via the
clipboard.

<a name="deleting">
<a name="Delete">
<h4>
Delete
</h4>
</a>
</a>
<p>
When the user selects <tt>Delete</tt> from the <tt>Edit</tt> menu, the system
deletes a field or cell from the spreadsheet.

<a name="finding">
<a name="Find">
<h4>
Find
</h4>
</a>
</a>
<p>
When the user selects <tt>Find</tt> from the <tt>Edit</tt> menu, the system
initiates a standard operating system "Finder" window to search for specific
strings within the spreadsheet's data.
<p>
Matching strings will be highlighted and a count will be displayed, similar to using a
"Command-F" command on a webpage. The user can toggle through them with arrows next to the
string matcher, and the finder bar is removed when the user clicks any other part of the
Grader display.
<p>
If the Find command is closed and used again, the previous string pattern that was searched for
remains, and progress is kept until the user deletes the string from the search bar.

<a name="clearing">
<a name="Clear">
<h4>
Clear
</h4>
</a>
</a>
<p>
When the user selects <tt>Clear</tt> from the <tt>Edit</tt> menu, the system
removes all information from a selected field. When paired with the "Shift" key to
select multiple items, the user may clear multiple items of data, such as category inputs
or whole rows of student data.
<p>
If nothing is selected and the <tt>Clear</tt> command is selected, there is no effect. On the contrary,
the user may use "Shift" to select the whole spreadsheet and clear all fields of information with the command.

<a name="filtering">
<a name="Filter">
<h4>
Filter
</h4>
</a>
</a>
<p>
When the user selects <tt>Filter</tt> from the <tt>Edit</tt> menu, the system brings
up a dialog for the user to select which items they want to view in the spreadsheet.
See <a href="filtering.html">Section 2.5.5</a> for more details and specifics.
