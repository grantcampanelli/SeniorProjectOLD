Description On Compiling
-----

Prior to compiling and running the prototype, you may copy the source directory (.../grader/prototype/src/) to a preferred location.

Once ready, Navigate (cd) to src directory and enter:

	javac *.java

The following warning may appear, but you may ignore it:

Note: Some input files use unchecked or unsafe operations.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.

Other than the warning, the complication should have finished without an error. You can launch the prototype with the following:

	java GraderAppMain
