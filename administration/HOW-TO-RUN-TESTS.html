    <h1>How to Run Unit Tests for Node Grader</h1>

    Our test runner is live at <a href="http://app.nodegrader.com/test.html">http://app.nodegrader.com/test.html</a>.<br>
    We are using <a href="https://qunitjs.com/">QUnit Javascript Unit Testing Framework</a> as our testing platform.<br>
    Unfortunately, our current testing framework does not include any code coverage tool (as of June 10, 2015 at 3PM).
