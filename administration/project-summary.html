<h2>
    Project Summary
</h2>

<p>
    We did not make mockups for various error messages as we went, and so at the end, for
    <a href="../requirements/error.html">section 2.9.3</a>, we chose to show the generic error
    dialog that would pop up for any of the listed error messages.
</p>
<p>
    A few items were left unimplemented due to time restrictions and are listed in
    <a href="../requirements/appendix-a.html">Appendix A</a> of the requirements.
