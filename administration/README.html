    <h3>Mike Ryu (doryu@calpoly.edu)</h3>
    I started this quarter with a nothing-to-none web development experience, along with the skepticism that the change
    of framework may cause significant issues in achieving the project's goal. Nonetheless, once we made a decision to
    make the big change as a team, I tried my best to get my web development skill up to speed to be able to contribute
    as much as I can in the limited time we had.<br><br>

    I went through <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/learn">codecademy</a>'s
    javascript tutorial to learn javascript for the first time, and also struggled through advanced topics covered in
    <a href="http://nodeschool.io/">node and express framework tutorials</a>. Although these tutorials were helpful,
    they surely could not cover all the plugins and additional frameworks we ended up using for the project. This
    created extra challenge as I had to learn how they worked in an extremely short period of time to produce
    prototypes and working elements that were required for different milestones of the project.<br><br>

    For every development task assigned to me, I had to spend 30% - 40% of the development period just reading the code
    written by Michael and other more web-development-proficient members just to understand how the framework has
    changed and what will and will not work with those changes. In addition, as Matt mentions below, due to the nature
    of our iterative development process (i.e. start with HTML dialogs - discard HTML dialogs - develop HBS template -
    discard the initial HBS template - re-write HBS to use modal ...), much of the work I did earlier in the quarter
    ended up being discarded without  being contributed to the final product of this project. I believe this definitely
    caused our final product to poorly reflect the time the team and I put in to get this application working.<br><br>

    It is very unfortunate that we were not able to achieve the initial goal we set in the beginning, but I would
    like to emphasize that I still put in my best effort to be a resourceful member of the team by doing what
    I did as mentioned above, and also by taking extra responsibilities such as managing all administrative
    documentation and organization tasks.<br><br>

    We as a team held a great potential that would've eventually shown if the quarter wasn't so short, and I deeply
    regret that we had to end the quarter with unsatisfactory outcome. But regrets aside,
    I am very grateful for Michael and Grant C's diligence and patience in taking a heavy load upon themselves to
    be the technical leads for the project, and that I got to experience a large-scale web development process through
    this project. I would also like to use this opportunity to thank Dr. Fisher for granting us extra generosity
    throughout the entire development process so we can move at a perfect pace that worked for all of us.

    I spent the beginning of this quarter getting up to speed with web development. I have worked with JavaScript somewhat before,
    but had never done any web development at all. I spent a long time learning about how web applications are structured and what
    the structure of our app would be like. I then learned how the MVC design pattern fits into modern web development. I went through
    all of the Node.js and Express tutorials in order to get up to speed with Node. Then I spent countless hours reading about MongoDB,
    Mongoose, Backbone.js, Restify, and Marionette. I also spent a lot of time with Michael talking about these technologies and
    asking him questions so that I could learn more. He also helped teach me about some more advanced JavaScript techniques that were being
    used in our application. While getting up to speed with these new technologies I was also practicing some basic front end web development
    with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, in order to produce our original dialogs. As I became more comfortable with Backbone, I began to
    dive into our front end development as much as I could to try to help Michael and Grant. I think what made things tough primarily
    was that we all had to rely on michael to figure out the architecture of our application. Being that he was the only person able to make
    these decisions early on, the architecture kept needing to be changed. Every time this happened, much of the code I had worked on would
    be rendered useless and need to be rewritten. Sometimes Michael would take it upon himself to make these changes, but that would often
    result in me needing to go back and try to understand what was changed in the file, as well as how the new libraries worked. None of this
    was Michael's fault. He worked incredibly hard on this project and did his best to help us along, but in the end the experienced web
    developers of the team just didn't have the time to explain all that they were doing while trying to tackle the more challenging
    part of the application. All in all I am still very happy that I was able to learn so much about web development, as it was always an
    area that I felt I was lacking in development skills. I feel that I worked extremely hard this quarter and only wish that there was
    more to show for it.
