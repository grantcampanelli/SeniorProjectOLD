    I spent the beginning of this quarter getting up to speed with web development. I have worked with JavaScript somewhat before,
    but had never done any web develoment at all. I spent a long time learning about how web applications are structured and what
    the structure of our app would be like. I then learned how the MVC design patttern fits into modern web development. I went through
    all of the Node.js and Express tutorials in order to get up to spped with Node. Then I spent countless hours reading about MongoDB,
    Mongoose, Backbone.js, Restify, and Marionette. I also spent a lot of time with Michael talking about these technologies and
    asking him questions so that I could learn more. He also helped teach me about some more advanced JavaScript techniques that were being
    used in our application. While getting up to speed with these new technologies I was also practicing some basic front end wb development
    with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, in order to produce our original dialogs. As I became more comfortable with Backbone, I began to
    dive into our front end development as much as I could to try to help Michael and Grant. I think what made things tough primarily
    was that we all had to rely on michael to figure out the architecture of our application. Being that he was the only person able to make
    these decisions early on, the architecture kept needing to be changed. Every time this happened, much of the code I had worked on would
    be rendered useless and need to be rewritten. Sometimes Michael would take it upon himself to make these changes, but that would often
    result in me needing to go back and try to understand what was changed in the file, as well as how the new libraries worked. None of this
    was Michael's fault. He worked incredibly hard on this project and did his best to help us along, but in the end the experienced web
    developers of the team just didn't have the time to explain all that they were doing while trying to tackle the more challenging
    part of the application. All in all I am still very happy that I was able to learn so much about web development, as it was always an
    area that I felt I was lacking in development skills. I feel that I worked extremely hard this quarter and only wish that there was
    more to show for it.
