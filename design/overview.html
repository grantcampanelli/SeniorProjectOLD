    This design documentation describes the packages of the Node Grader software
    system.  The system is comprised of two application programs:
<ul>
    <li>
        the Node Grader web interface, for regular users to manage and view their calendars
    <li>
        the Calendar Tool Administration program, for administrators to manage
        databases and control other functions of Calendar Tool central hosts
    <li>
        the Node Grader Server, which runs in the background on central hosts to
        control communication among users' local computers and the host
</ul>
